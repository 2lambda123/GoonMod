# GoonMod for Payday 2

### No Longer Supported
Hi, hello. GoonMod development is no longer supported. It was a fun few years, I made a lot of things, learned a lot, developed a modding tool for a game, and used both to get me a job working on Payday 2 proper, but it's time to move on. GoonMod will not recieve any more updates, and using it in it's current state will likely cause your game to crash.  
If you really that badly need this mod in your life, you can find most of it's components scattered around the internet available as individual mods.

### Installation
GoonMod requires the [Payday 2 BLT](http://paydaymods.com/download/) in order to run.  
Once the BLT is installed, place the `GoonMod` folder into the `mods` folder.
